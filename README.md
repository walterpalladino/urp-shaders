 Unity URP Shaders

I'm using on this examples assets from the FREE package from the Unity Asset Store:

- Low Poly Tree Pack from Broken Vector (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/vegetation/trees/low-poly-tree-pack-57866)
- FREE assets from Quaternius site (https://quaternius.com/)
- textures from https://3dtextures.me/
- Free folliage textures from the Unity Asset Store: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/vegetation/yughues-free-stylized-foliages-13392
- Unity Cat from: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/tutorial-projects/endless-runner-sample-game-87901
